    question: "Who manages this website?",
    answer:
      "All of the infrastructure is handled by [skepfusky](https://skepfusky.xyz) - from database and hosting costs, this website and all its content associated with it.",
  },
  {
    question: "How did you manage to get the Lucky fonts?",
    answer:
      "I managed to get the fonts via their official website and through Wayback Machine with the use of the browser DevTools and nabbing the URL if you know where to look.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why would you work on this website rather than the wiki?",
    answer:
      "Firstly, it feels limited on what I can and cannot do design-wise, such as Fandom's template system can be confusing and hard to understand at some point. And secondly, it's closely tighted to the Fandom wiki network - I wanted to expand further and build a website to standout when it comes to community-curated content and from now much lengths I'm going through to provide a single source of truth for all Lucky content.",
  },
  {
    question: "What inspired/motivated you to start this project?",
    answer:
      "I got the idea when I was looking through [this ancient Balto fansite from 2001](https://fluke.theicecave.org/main.shtml) and with I've got skills with web development so far and with over 8,000+ edits from the Lucky's Tale Wiki, I decided to begin the project in late-2021.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What will you do if Playful themselves stumble upon this website?",
    answer:
      "I'm very paranoid when it comes to copyright laws since I'm from the Philippines - let's just hope that they doesn't file a cease and desist on this entire project; otherwise, I will immediately shutdown TFV no questions asked. I would honestly sigh in relief if they are okay with this project and continue to maintain it.",
